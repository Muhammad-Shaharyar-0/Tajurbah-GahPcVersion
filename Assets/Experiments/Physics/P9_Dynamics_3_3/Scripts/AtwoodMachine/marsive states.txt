start/re-set
**swinging** (can't add weights or operate stop-watch or save observations until stabilised)
**stabilised** note height of m1
apply gravity to mass hangers by clicking on stop-watch (while m1 is **dropping**, can't add/remove any masses, can't save, can't re-set stop-watch)
when **m1 hits the ground**, stop "actual time" and freeze the mass hangers
when user stops the stop-watch, note height of m1
get user to calculate height of fall - user can dismiss this UI, in which case these readings will not be saved and the practical will be re-set
user clicks on "save" to save the height and time taken for the fall, after which the practical will be re-set
